# Description

Repository for the Bluetooth module BT832 programming (Aalto University).

# Bluetooth module BT832

Programming was done using the Nordic SDK for nRF52 on a Windows environment. The code developped is an adaptation of the ble_app_uart example provided in the Nordic SDK.

# Getting started

## Setup

If you don't have it, get the following:
- nRF Command Line Tools (nrfjprog) + JLink Software available on the <a href='https://www.nordicsemi.com'>Nordic official website</a>
- Nordic SDK 15.3.0 also available on <a href='https://www.nordicsemi.com'>their website</a>
- GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors 4.9 2015 or higher
- Make for Windows 3.81 or higher <br>

Make sure that nrfjprog and JLink are in your PATH.
Then, go to `<SDK folder>/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_uart` and replace the file `main.c` by the file provided in this repository. Do the same for the file `sdk_config.h` located at `<SDK folder>/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_uart/pca10040/s132/config`, and for the file `Makefile` located at `<SDK folder>/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_uart/pca10040/s132/armgcc`. If you want additional debugging information when connecting to the Bluetooth module while the JLink probe is on, enable the JLink Virtual COM port by entering the JLink CLI with `jlink` from the Command Prompt and typing `vcom enable`. Also replace `ble_nus.c` at `<SDK folder>Â§components/ble/ble_services/ble_nus` with the file of the same name from repository.
<br>
To be able to compile the file and to flash it, we need to provide the Makefile with environment specific options. Navigate to `<SDK folder>/components/toolchain/gcc` and edit these lines on the file `Makefile.windows` based on your own configuration, for example: <br>
`GNU_INSTALL_ROOT := D:/Software/GNU_ARM_4.9-2015-q3/4.9 2015q3/bin/`<br>
`GNU_VERSION := 7.3.1` <br>
`GNU_PREFIX := arm-none-eabi` <br>

## Compiling and flashing the code

Compiling and flashing are done at the same time. Simply navigate to the folder that contains the Makefile, i.e. `<SDK folder>/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_uart/pca10040/s132/armgcc`, and from the Command Prompt (or Powershell) execute the command `make flash`. Note that if you erase the board with `make erase` or `nrfjprog --eraseall`, you will need need to flash the SoftDevice with `make flash_softdevice` before flashing your code. This SoftDevice is an essential component for the module and your program will not work if it is not flashed into the device before flashing the actual program.
In order to enable debugging with JLink, you have to open JLinkRTTViewer and connect to the device.

## Connecting to the Bluetooth module

Connection is made via the Nordic nRF Connect mobile app. There are applications for pairing with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices on Windows, such as Bluetooth LE Explorer; however, this one occasionnally encountered bugs that were not present when connecting from the mobile app nRF Connect.
